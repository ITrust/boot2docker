boot2docker images used at ITrust

Iso are generated using a custom dockerfile as described in [boot2docker/boot2docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/blob/master/doc/BUILD.md)

The main customization is the installation of python 2.7 package. This enables the use of Ansible for provisioning.
